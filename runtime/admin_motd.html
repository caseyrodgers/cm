<h1>Coming soon: Web Links</h1>

<p> 
Soon you will be able to customize Catchup Math lessons by adding links to any resources on the Internet that you choose.
</p>

<p>
There will also be a public library of links used by other schools.
</p>
 
 <p>
If you have favorite math games, videos, activities, or other resources that you recommend we add to the public library, please email the links to support@hotmath.com for consideration.
</p>

<p> 
We are especially interested in non-Flash games for the iPad.

Thank you!
