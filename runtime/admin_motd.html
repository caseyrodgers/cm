       <h1>New Built-in Custom Program for CCSS Optional Standards</h1>
       <ul>
           <li>
              We added a new built-in Custom Program called Optional Topics that
              includes lessons for topics in the CCSS optional category.
           </li>
           <li>
              You can copy the Optional Topics custom program to choose desired
              lessons, and also use it for creating custom quizzes.
           </li>
        </ul>
