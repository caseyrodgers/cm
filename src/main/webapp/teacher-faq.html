                    <h2><a href='javascript:void(0)'>How do I register students?</a></h2>
                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                        There are three basic ways to get students registered and ready to work:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Manual Registration - You enter each student name and assign an individual
                                password which you then give to the student. This works best when you have a
                                small number of students to register. (This is the Register One Student option
                                under Student Registration on the Admin page.)</li>
                            <li>Self Registration - All students are given your school Login Name and a special
                                Group password. When they log in for the first time they will be automatically
                                assigned a unique password based on the registration data they enter. This is
                                more efficient than manual registration as it eliminates the need for you to
                                type in student names and create passwords.</li>
                            <li>File Upload - Student names and passwords (which could be their student ID) can
                                be uploaded from a two-column tab-delimited file with student name in the first column.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class='faq-item'>
                    <h2><a href='javascript:void(0)'>How does Self Registration work?</a></h2>
                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                        Self Registration allows students to receive a computer-generated password and immediately
                        start Catchup Math.  You give all students the same Group password, which will be the name
                        of the Group to which you want them assigned.  Students log in the first time using your
                        school Login Name and this Group password, and are prompted through steps that set up their
                        personal password. From then on the student logs in under the school Login Name and their
                        new personal password.  You can create your Self Registration groups by using the Register
                        Student button and then clicking the Self Registration option.  Or, you can choose an existing
                        Self Registration group from those listed in red in the Manage Groups listing.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class='faq-item'>
                    <h2><a href='javascript:void(0)'>How do I upload student names and passwords from a file?</a></h2>
                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                       First, create a two-column tab-delimited text file where column 1 has student names
                       (e.g., Smith, Robin) and column 2 has the password (e.g., student id). Then, click the Student
                       Registration button, click the Bulk Registration option, and provide the requested information.
                       Moments later, you are ready to tell students to log on using the school Login Name and their
                       individual passwords.
                    </div>
                </li>

                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                        Select the student from the list on the Admin page, then use the Student Registration pull-down
                        menu and select the Unregister Student option.  (Note: if you only want to change the password
                        or the spelling of the name, you can use the Edit Student button and the student history will be
                        retained.)
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class='faq-item'>
                    <h2><a href='javascript:void(0)'>How can we group students into different classes or teachers?</a></h2>
                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                        When you register students you are asked to create or use a Group Name that is appropriate.
                        Most schools start group names with the teacher name followed by the class period (e.g., Brown3).
                        The Manage Group button gives you some tools to make changes easily.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li class='faq-item'>

                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                        On the Admin page, click on Program Details and select the Program and Section for which you want
                        the list of topics.

                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                        When you register that student, select the manual registration option (Register One Student) and
                        then select Auto-Enrollment from the Program pull-down menu. This option provides an entry-level
                        diagnostic quiz that automatically places the student in the appropriate Proficiency Program based
                        on the quiz results.
                    </div>
                </li>

                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                        At the bottom left of the Admin page, choose the Group you want listed by using the Group pull-down
                        menu box.  You can further refine the listing with the text search box. For example, if you want to
                        see all the students in the Brown1 group who are still in the Pre-Algebra Program, you would select
                        that group and then type Pre-Alg in the text-search box.
                    </div>

                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                        Yes, click any column heading and the students will be sorted using that column.  This is an easy
                        way to check recent logins, see who is falling behind, or see who is utilizing the online tutoring
                        and how frequently.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Passing percent: The default percent to pass a quiz is 70%. You may change that to 60% or 80%
                                under Advanced Options when you set up Student Registration.</li>
                            <li>Show Work: You can require students to Show Work on the interactive whiteboard in order to
                                proceed through the required practice problems. If you use this option, we recommend you do
                                view the work (an option under Student Detail History) to ensure students are entering meaningful
                                work and not making minimal entries to simply "get through the problem".</li>
                            <li>Limit Games: The Advanced Options under Student Registration allows you to decide whether or
                                not to limit the use of games to one game per lesson. The games do have both a learning and
                                motivational value; however, if you find students are spending too much time on games, at the
                                expense of making progress through the assigned lessons, you may want to activate the limit
                                either on the entire group (Manage Groups) or on individual students (Edit Student) as needed.</li>
                            <li>Stop at End of Program: Students are automatically advanced to the next Proficiency Program
                                after completing all lessons in the assigned program. If you do not want this to occur (e.g.
                                advancing to Algebra 1 when they complete all the Pre-Algebra lessons), select the Stop at End
                                of Program Option under the Advanced Options.</li>
                            <li>Enable Tutoring: If your school subscribes to the Live Tutoring option, you can control which
                                group(s) or which individual students may use it.</li>

                        Student passwords are assigned during initial registration either by you or by the computer
                        (Self-Registration). The student does not have an option to later change this password, which prevents
                        students from creating "inappropriate" passwords. However, if a student forgets their password, you
                        can easily view it from the Admin screen. Also, if for some reason you did want to change a student
                        password, you can do it under the Edit Student option on the Admin screen.

                        In 2009, we analyzed data from one month of usage in which students using the Catchup Math Proficiency
                        Programs passed more than 28,000 quizzes. Each passed quiz in these programs demonstrates mastery of
                        one-sixth of the full Program. (Each Proficiency Program is divided into 6 sections, with multiple
                        topics in each section.) On average, students passed a quiz after 2.2 login sessions, which included an
                        average of 4.5 remediation topics reviewed (about 2 topics per session). Based on this data, students
                        using Catchup Math for two sessions per week could master all topics within a Proficiency Program in
                        approximately seven weeks on average.

                        that answers which students type in the Enter-Answer option (during the required Practice Problems)
                        is not saved for you to view. The Enter-Answer option is provided for some (but not all) Practice
                        Problems for students who know the answer. If they get it right they need not click through the hints
                        and steps to get the problem checked off.  If their answer is incorrect, they will need to complete the

                        Students are rarely looking at the same quiz at the same time.  Most of our programs have multiple
