                            There are three ways to get students registered and ready to use Catchup Math.
                            <ol>
                            <li value='1'>Manual Registration - You enter each student's name and assign an individual password which you then give the
                                students. This works best when you have a small number of students to register. (This is the Register One Student
                                option under Student Registration on the Admin page.)</li>
                            <li>Self Registration - All students are given your school Login Name and a special Group password. When they log in
                                for the first time, they are automatically assigned a unique password based on the registration data they enter.
                                This is more efficient than manual registration as it eliminates the need for you to type in student names and
                                create passwords. (This is the Self Registration option under Student Registration on the Admin page.)</li>
                            <li>Bulk Upload - Student names and passwords (which could be their student IDs) can be uploaded from a two-column
                                tab-delimited text file with the student names in the first column (e.g. Smith, John) and the chosen passwords
                                (e.g. student ID) in the second column. (This is the Bulk Upload option under Student Registration on the Admin page.)</li>
                            </ol>
                            For detailed information, please view our <a href='/training-videos'>Registering Students</a> video.
                        </div>
                    </div>

                <li class='faq-item'>
                    <h2><a href='javascript:void(0)'>How does Self Registration work?</a></h2>
                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                        <div class='wrap'>
                            Self Registration allows students to receive a personal password and immediately start using Catchup Math. You will
                            first need to create a Group Name and choose a Program to assign to your students. You then give all students the same
                            temporary password, which is the Group Name you just created. Students log in the first time using your school Login
                            Name and this Group Name password, and are prompted to set up their personal password. From then on, the students log
                            in using the school Login Name and their new personal password. You can create your Self Registration Groups by selecting
                            Self Registration under Student Registration on the Admin page. Or, you can choose an existing Self Registration Group
                            by selecting Manage Groups under Student Registration and then choosing from the Group Names listed in red.

                    <div class='faq-item-content'>
                        <div class='wrap'>
                            First, create a two-column tab-delimited text file where column 1 has student names (e.g. Jones, Robin) and column 2 has
                            passwords (e.g. student ID). You can use Excel's "Save As..." drop down menu to save as a Text (Tab delimited) file.
                            Then, select Bulk Upload under Student Registration on the Admin page. Create a Group Name and choose a Program to assign
                            to your students.  Follow the instructions under Upload Students. Moments later, you are ready to tell students to log into
                            Catchup Math using the school Login Name and their individual passwords.

                            (Note: if you only want to change the student’s password or the spelling of the name, you can use the Edit Student
                            button and the student history will be retained.) To delete multiple students, select Manage Groups (found under Student
                            Registration on the Admin Screen), click on the group of students you wish to delete, and select Unregister Students.

                            When you register students you are asked to create or use a Group Name. Most schools start Group Names with the teacher's
                            name followed by the class period (e.g., Brown3). The Manage Groups button (found under Student Registration on the Admin
                            screen) gives you some tools to easily make changes to your Groups.  For detailed information, please view our

                            Catchup Math provides a variety of options for assigning content, including Subject Proficiency Programs (reviews
                            a full subject), Subject and Chapter programs (includes material based on scope and sequence correlated with typical
                            textbook chapter topics), Graduation Prep Programs, and Custom Programs. You assign content when registering students.
                            It is easy to re-assign students to different Programs if needed. For detailed information, please view our

                            Yes, the Parallel Program tool enables you to assign multiple separate Programs to students, allowing them to
                            "toggle" between their assignments. For example, a student can be working on a Subject/Chapter Program in their
                            regular math class, as well as a separate Proficiency Program in their math lab. Or, teachers can use this feature
                            to assign extra work or a Custom Program or Quiz.  Parallel Programs can be found by clicking on the Student

                            You can require students to utilize the Extra Practice Problems (and show their work on their whiteboards) or
                            use the Skill Builders to get additional practice. Also, by viewing the most frequently assigned lessons from
                            the Assessment button on the Admin page, you can determine if there are specific topics for which one or more
                            students may need additional instruction. With this information, you can create and assign Custom Programs,
                            or provide assistance outside of Catchup Math.
