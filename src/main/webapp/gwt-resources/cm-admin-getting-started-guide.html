        </p>
        <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          Catchup Math operates on iPad, PCs, Macs and netbooks. Desktop computers require Flash (Verion 8 or higher).
          You can verify your computer's compatibility with Catchup Math
          by clicking on the <a target='_blank' href='/system_checker.jsp'>Check compatibility</a> link at the log in screen.
          An iPad version of Catchup Math can be accessed at m.catchupmath.com.
          Operation on the iPad does not include the math games.
        </p>
        <h2>Quick Start</h2>
        <p>
          Instruct students to go to catchupmath.com, enter your school's Login Name (e.g. jfk123) and one of the following group
          names as their temporary password: <strong>essentials</strong>, <strong>prealgebra</strong>, <strong>algebra1</strong>,
          <strong>geometry</strong>, <strong>algebra2</strong>, or <strong>quizme</strong> (quizme will deliver one or more quizzes
          to place them into the lowest program where they need help).  Students will be prompted to self-register and can start
          immediately on the program to which they've been assigned.
        </p>
        <h2>Select the Right Program for Each Student</h2>
        <p>
          Catchup Math will reviews and remediate the assigned subject. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              To prepare students for Pre-Algebra or Algebra 1, select the Subject Proficiency Program called Essentials.
            </li>
            <li>
              For students entering Geometry, enroll them in the Pre-Algebra Proficiency Program; they will be automatically
              advanced to Algebra 1 Proficiency when they have successfully reviewed their Pre-Algebra learning gaps.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are not sure where to place a student, assign the Auto-Enrollment Program (or use the quizme self-registration group).
              The student will be given one or more quizzes to place them into the lowest program where
              they need help.  Then, you can monitor their progress until they advance to their targeted level. 
            </li>
            <li>
              To concentrate on a specific topic (roughly correlated with the chapters in leading
              math textbooks), select a "Subject and Chapter" Program.  Then select a subject and chapter topic
              from the drop-down menus. 
            </li>
            <li>
              To prepare for a graduation exam, choose one of our Graduation Prep Programs.
              The National Graduation Prep Program is aligned to CCSS.
            </li>
            <li>
              For your most struggling students, you can assign them one or more of the Custom Programs, CP: Essentials Topics
              (grades 3-7 math), CP: Foundations A (grades 3-4 math), or CP: Foundations B (grades 5-6 math). They will review the
              lessons but will not need to take quizzes. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Register Students</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
              To manually register one or more students, select Register One Student under the Student Registration button.
            </li>
            <li>
              To easily register multiple students, select the Self Registration option under the Student Registration button.
              You create a Group name and select a program. Students login using your school Login Name (e.g., jfk123) and
              your newly-created Group name as their temporary password.  They will be prompted to create a personal password
              based on name and birth date, which they will use for future logins.
            </li>
            <li>
              To register students from an uploaded file, use the Bulk Registration option. You can assign
              both a Group name and a specific program for everyone in the file.  a Tab Delimited Text file with two columns;
              the first column as the student name (e.g., Smith, John), and the second column as password (e.g., 23242342).
              Use Excel's "Save As..." drop down menu to save as a Text (tab delimited) file.
            </li>
            <li>
              To make any change to a registered student account, select the student and then use Edit Student.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tell Students How to Log In</h2>
        <p>
          Instruct students to go to catchupmath.com and enter the school Login Name (e.g., jfk123) and their 
          personal password.  Try this yourself with the John Doe sample student using the password jd12345.
        </p>

        <h2>Give Students a Brief Outline of How Catchup Math Works</h2>
        <p>
          For most of our programs (excluding Custom Programs), students will be given quizzes.  Based on
          the quiz items they get wrong, the program will assign one or more review topics. Students can see which topics
          were assigned by clicking on the NEXT button on their student screen.  For each review topic,
          there are practice problems to solve, lessons to read, videos to watch, and activities to try.
          At a minimum, students must attempt the required practice problems or problem sets and receive a
          check-mark in order to complete the topic. But students should be encouraged to try the other resources
          as well.  Once the quiz has been passed and the topics reviewed, students are advanced to the next
          section of the program.  Students can also watch an overview video when they log into Catchup Math.
        </p>

        <h2>Tell Students How You Want Them to Use Catchup Math</h2>
        <p>
          Students should answer the quiz questions carefully, working out their answers with pencil and paper 
          or the online whiteboard. 
          You might give students a goal for their next session, such as to work until they have passed
          at least one quiz.
        </p>

        <h2>Best Practices in a Computer Lab</h2>
        <p>
          Visit each student, offer assistance as needed, and make sure the student is trying all the 
          various learning resources. Also, review their progress on the spot by clicking the Help button
          on their screen and then clicking the Student History button.
          You can also monitor your students' progress during a class period from your Admin screen to see who
          is excelling and who is falling behind.  Simply set the Date Range (both From and To) to <strong>Today</strong>
          and click on the Highlights tool from time to time during class, to instantly see who to congratulate - and who
          needs more of your help.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Use the "Show Whiteboard" Feature</h2>
        <p>
          Students show their work on the whiteboard by typing, drawing with the mouse, and using the graph
          template or scientific calculator. 
          You can view their work at any time using the Show Work button under Student Detail History on
          your Admin screen.
        </p>

        <h2>Monitoring Individual Student Progress</h2>
        <p>
          The Student Detail History button will present a reverse chronological history for a selected student.
          While viewing the history, select any line and click on Show Topics to view the lessons (and standards) covered
          and those which the student was prescribed to review.  Also, the work entered on the whiteboard may be viewed
          by selecting Show Work. The Report Card summarizes student progress and effort including their prescribed lessons.  
          The student summary page may be printed for all registered students or for any selected group within any
          date range. The Student Detail History and Report Card may also be printed.
        </p>

        <h2>Monitoring Group Progress</h2>
        <p>
          Select students by using the "Select a group", "Text search", and "Date Range" filters at the bottom
          of the Admin screen then press Assessment on the menu bar to view charts of lessons most frequently prescribed
          as well as general progress.  The Highlights tool generates multiple reports including Greatest Effort,
          Least Effort, Most Quizzes Passed, Highest Average Quiz Score, Most Failures of Current Quiz, and more.
          You can also export overview and details reports into Excel by clicking on the Export button on the menu bar
          and entering your email address. The report will immediately be emailed to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Custom Programs and Custom Quizzes</h2>
        <p>
          Custom Programs lets you choose and assign any sequence of lessons to students, without quizzes. Summary and detail 
          reporting will monitor progress, and you can review student work on the whiteboard.
          Similarly, you can create Custom Quizzes by choosing questions from our item bank.
        </p>

        <h2>Program Details</h2>
        <p>
