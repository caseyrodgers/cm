                <b>Training and support:</b>
                We provide free telephone training as well as telephone support to teachers.  
                Call 510-524-5525 during Pacific Coast business hours.  Also, teachers and 
                students can email support@hotmath.com at any time for 1-2 day response.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Technical requirements:</b>
                Operation requires Flash (version 8 or later).  Otherwise, Catchup Math should work 
                with any modern browser (PC or MAC) from any broadband internet connection.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Register students:</b>
                Use the Register Student button.  The Help button at the upper right explains the
                various registration fields and their meaning.  To make a change to a registered student,
                select that student and then use Edit Student.  Soon you will be able to upload an Excel
                registration file or use Quick Register to create passwords instantly.      
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Select the right program for each student:</b>
                Catchup Math will remediate and review the named subject.  
                For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                         To prepare students for Algebra 1, select the Pre-algebra Proficiency program.
                    </li>
                    <!--
                    <li>
                         To provide review of Areas and Volumes, select that specific Pre-algebra Chapter program.
                    </li>
                    -->
                    <li>
                        For a weak student about to take Geometry, enroll them in Pre-Algebra Proficiency 
                        (they will be automatically advanced to Algebra 1 when they have successfully reviewed
                        their Pre-Algebra learning gaps).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you are not sure where to place a student, use the Auto-Enrollment program. The
                        student will be given one or more quizzes to place them in the lowest program where
                        they need help.  Then, you can monitor their progress until they advance to the target level. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To concentrate on a specific topic (roughly correlated with the chapters in leading
                        math textbooks), select a "Subject and Chapter" program.  Then select a chapter topic
                        from the drop-down menu. 
                    </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Other registration options:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                         Choose a "Pass Percent" for the quizzes.  This is the minimum required quiz score for
                         students to advance to the next set of lessons after completing the prescribed review
                         and practice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         When students are given practice problems, you can require that they enter their own
                         answer using a virtual whiteboard, before they see solutions.  (Note that this feature
                         is more useful in higher-level courses; in Pre-Algebra, there is often not much work to
                         show.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Tell students how to log in:</b>
                Tell students to go to catchupmath.com and then enter the school Login Name and their individual Password.  
                Try this yourself with the jd12345 sample student.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Give students a brief outline of how Catchup Math works:</b>
                Students will be given quizzes.  Based on the problems they get wrong, the program will select
                one or more review topics. For each review topic, there are practice problems to solve, lessons
                to read, videos to watch, activities to try out.  At a minimum, the students must attempt the
                required practice problems and view the solutions all the way to the end in order to proceed to
                the next topic. But students should be encouraged to try the other resources as well.  Once the
                quiz has been passed and the topics reviewed, students are advanced to the next section of the
                program that covers new topics.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Tell students how you want them to use Catchup Math:</b>
                Students will do best with Catchup Math when they know what you expect.  
                You might tell students something like one or these:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Your goal is write your answers to the Required Problems on the Show Work screen 
                        so I can review your work - please enter your answers as if this were homework.  
                        Feel free to improve your answers after viewing the lessons or tutorials.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You goal is to proceed through the assigned program to the end.  
                        I will be reviewing your quiz scores to see how you are doing, so please try your best on the quizzes.  
                        Do not worry about a poor score on a quiz, because you will be given a chance to improve your score 
                        after the review and practice.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Your goal is to complete the Algebra 1 and Geometry program at your own pace, as that covers the material
                        you will need to be successful in Algebra 2. You will only be graded on whether or not you have completed
                        the programs, not on the whiteboard answers or intermediate quiz scores.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Complete at least 12 Required Problems for homework.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         Work until you score at least 70% on a quiz.
                     </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                 <b>Best practices in a computer lab:</b>
                 Make sure the students have a way to hear the videos - you may need to buy them some headsets.
                 Also, if you can provide each student with a stylus tablet, they will find that easier to enter
                 their Show Work answers.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>How to use the Show Work feature:</b>
                 Students enter their own answers on an electronic whiteboard, and you can view their work at any
                 time. Be sure to tell students what you expect. You might require them to show their work on all
                 the Practice Problems, or only problems where they need help.   If you are requiring the use of
                 the whiteboard, it is best to give feedback to the students.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>Monitoring student progress:</b>
                 The Show Student History button will present a reverse chronological history for a selected student.
                 While viewing the history, select any line to view the lessons (standards) covered and those which
                 the student was prescribed to review.  Also, the entered "Show Work" may be viewed. 
             </li>
             
             <li>
                 <b>College course names:</b>
                 At present we are using the school course names as follows, but our programs apply to college courses as follows:
                 <ul>
                     <li>Pre-Algebra = Pre-Algebra</li>
                     <li>Beginning or Introductory Algebra = Algebra 1</li>
                     <li>Basic Geometry = Geometry</li>
                     <li>Intermediate Algebra = Algebra 2</li>
                  </ul>
             </li>
        </ul>
