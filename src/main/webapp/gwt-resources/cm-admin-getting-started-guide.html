                                This page is a quick reference for our reporting and management features. 
                                We also have an excellent 30 minute <a href='/teacher-training-video.html'>teacher video</a>.
                                For details, see our <a href='/teacher-faq.html'>Teacher FAQ</a>. But please, feel free to
                                call your <a href='/contact.html'>Account Manager</a> at any time for phone support, a 
                                group webinar, or a personal training session.

                        <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
                        <p>
                          Operation requires Flash (version 8 or later). Catchup Math should work with any 
                          modern browser on a full-sized PC or MAC from any broadband internet connection.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Quick Start</h2>
                        <p>
                                 Check in Manage Groups for red-colored group names.
                                 Students go to catchupmath.com, enter your school Login Name and use the group name 
                                 as the password. Students will be prompted to self-register and can start immediately
                                 on the associated program.                 
                        </p>
                        <h2>Select the Right Program for Each Student</h2>
                        <p>
                                Catchup Math will remediate and review the named subject.  
                                For example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                 To prepare students for Algebra 1, select the Pre-Algebra Proficiency program.
                            </li>
                            <!--
                            <li>
                                 To provide review of Areas and Volumes, select that specific Pre-algebra Chapter program.
                            </li>
                            -->
                            <li>
                                For a weak student about to take Geometry, enroll them in Pre-Algebra Proficiency 
                                (they will be automatically advanced to Algebra 1 when they have successfully reviewed
                                their Pre-Algebra learning gaps).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you are not sure where to place a student, use the Auto-Enrollment program. The
                                student will be given one or more quizzes to place them in the lowest program where
                                they need help.  Then, you can monitor their progress until they advance to the target level. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To concentrate on a specific topic (roughly correlated with the chapters in leading
                                math textbooks), select a "Subject and Chapter" program.  Then select a chapter topic
                                from the drop-down menu. 
                            </li>
                            
                            <li>
                                To prepare for a graduation exam, choose one of our Graduation Prep programs.
                            </li>

                                To easily register multiple students, use the Self Registration option. You create a 
                                Group with the specific program for everyone in the group. Students can then log in with 
                                your school Login Name and the group name to create their own individual name and password.
                                
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To register students from an uploaded file, use the Bulk Registration option. You again create
                                 a Group with the specific program for everyone in the group, then upload a text file in tab 
                                 separated format containing student names and their password.                    
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To make any change to a registered student account, select the student and then use Edit Student.
                            </li>
                         </ul>

                          <h2>Tell Students How to Log In</h2>
                          <p>
                            Tell students to go to catchupmath.com and then enter the school Login Name and their 
                            individual Password.  Try this yourself with the jd12345 sample student.
                          </p>

                          <h2>Give Students a Brief Outline of How Catchup Math Works</h2>
                          <p>
                                Students will be given quizzes.  Based on the problems they get wrong, the program will select
                                one or more review topics. For each review topic, there are practice problems to solve, lessons
                                to read, videos to watch, activities to try out.  At a minimum, students must attempt the required
                                practice problems or activities and receive a check-mark in order to proceed to the next topic.
                                But students should be encouraged to try the other resources as well.  Once the quiz has been
                                passed and the topics reviewed, students are advanced to the next section of the program that
                                covers new topics.
                           </p>

                           <p>
                                Students should answer the quizzes carefully, working out their answers with pencil and paper 
                                or our whiteboard, so they only receive lessons they really need. 
                                You might give students a goal for their next session, such as work until you have passed at 
                                least two quizzes.
