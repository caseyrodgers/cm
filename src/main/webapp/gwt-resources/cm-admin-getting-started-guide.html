                <b>Training and support:</b>
                We provide free telephone training as well as telephone support to teachers.  
                Call 925-202-4376 or 510-524-5525 during Pacific Coast business hours. 
                Also, teachers and students can email support@hotmath.com at any time for 1-2 day response.

            <li>
                <b>Technical requirements:</b>
                Operation requires Flash (version 8 or later).  Otherwise, Catchup Math should work 
                with any modern browser (PC or MAC) from any broadband internet connection.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Select the right program for each student:</b>
                Catchup Math will remediate and review the named subject.  
                For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                         To prepare students for Algebra 1, select the Pre-Algebra Proficiency program.
                    </li>
                    <!--
                    <li>
                         To provide review of Areas and Volumes, select that specific Pre-algebra Chapter program.
                    </li>
                    -->
                    <li>
                        For a weak student about to take Geometry, enroll them in Pre-Algebra Proficiency 
                        (they will be automatically advanced to Algebra 1 when they have successfully reviewed
                        their Pre-Algebra learning gaps).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you are not sure where to place a student, use the Auto-Enrollment program. The
                        student will be given one or more quizzes to place them in the lowest program where
                        they need help.  Then, you can monitor their progress until they advance to the target level. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To concentrate on a specific topic (roughly correlated with the chapters in leading
                        math textbooks), select a "Subject and Chapter" program.  Then select a chapter topic
                        from the drop-down menu. 
                    </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Register students:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To manually register one or more students, use the Student Registration button.                   
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To easily register multiple students, use the Self Registration option. You create a 
                        Group with the specific program for everyone in the group. Students can then log in with 
                        your school Login Name and the group name to create their own individual name and password.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To register students from an uploaded file, use the Bulk Registration option. You again create
                         a Group with the specific program for everyone in the group, then upload a text file in tab 
                         separated format containing student names and their password.                    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To make any change to a registered student account, select the student and then use Edit Student.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Tell students how to log in:</b>
                Tell students to go to catchupmath.com and then enter the school Login Name and their individual Password.  
                Try this yourself with the jd12345 sample student.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Give students a brief outline of how Catchup Math works:</b>
                Students will be given quizzes.  Based on the problems they get wrong, the program will select
                one or more review topics. For each review topic, there are practice problems to solve, lessons
                to read, videos to watch, activities to try out.  At a minimum, the students must attempt the
                required practice problems and view the solutions all the way to the end in order to proceed to
                the next topic. But students should be encouraged to try the other resources as well.  Once the
                quiz has been passed and the topics reviewed, students are advanced to the next section of the
                program that covers new topics.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Tell students how you want them to use Catchup Math:</b>
                The most important thing to tell students is that they should use pencil and paper for the quizzes, 
                so they are only assigned the lessons they really need. You may wish to give students a goal 
                for their next use of Catchup Math, e.g., work until you have passed at least two quizzes, or 
                try all the Flash Card activities, or use the Enter Your Answer whiteboard for 10 practice problems, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                 <b>Best practices in a computer lab:</b>
                 Make sure the students have a way to hear the videos - you may need to buy them some headsets.
                 Also, if you can provide each student with a stylus tablet, they will find that easier to enter
                 their Show Work answers.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>How to use the Show Work feature:</b>
                 Students enter their own steps and answers on a virtual whiteboard by writing with the mouse. 
                 You can view their work at any time using the Student Detail History button.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>Monitoring student progress:</b>
                 The Student Detail History button will present a reverse chronological history for a selected student.
                 While viewing the history, select any line to view the lessons (standards) covered and those which
                 the student was prescribed to review.  Also, the entered "Show Work" may be viewed. 
                 There is a Report Card that summarizes student progress and effort including their prescribed lessons.  
                 The student summary page may be printed for the all registered students or for any selected group.  
                 The Student Detail History and Report Card may also be printed.
             </li>
             
             <li>
                 <b>College course names:</b>
                 At present we are using the school course names, but our programs apply to college courses as follows:
                 <ul>
                     <li>Pre-Algebra = Pre-Algebra</li>
                     <li>Beginning or Introductory Algebra = Algebra 1</li>
                     <li>Basic Geometry = Geometry</li>
                     <li>Intermediate Algebra = Algebra 2</li>
                  </ul>
             </li>
        </ul>
