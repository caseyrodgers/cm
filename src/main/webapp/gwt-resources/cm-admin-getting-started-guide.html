                <b>Technical requirements:</b>
                Operation requires Flash (version 9 or later).  Otherwise, Catchup Math should work 
                with any modern browser (PC or MAC) from any broadband internet connection.

            <li>
                <b>Register students:</b>
                Use the Register Student button.  At the moment, you must register students one at a time.  
                In the future you will be able to upload a registration file or use Quick Enroll to create 
                passwords instantly.  The Help button at the upper right explains the various registration 
                options and their meaning.         
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Select the right program for each student:</b>
                Catchup Math will remediate and review the named subject.  
                For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                         To prepare students for Algebra 1, select the Pre-algebra Proficiency program.
                    </li>
                    <!--
                    <li>
                         To provide review of Areas and Volumes, select that specific Pre-algebra Chapter program.
                    </li>
                    -->
                    <li>
                        For a weak student about to take Geometry, enroll them in Pre-algebra Proficiency 
                        (they will be automatically advanced to Algebra 1 when they have reviewed their Pre-algebra).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         For a weak student who is currently taking Geometry, you might enroll him/her in specific Algebra 1 
                         Chapters where a boost is needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                         If you have no idea about a student, use the Auto-Enrollment feature.  
                         Then, monitor their progress until they advance to the desired level.
                    </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Tell students how to log in:</b>
                Tell students to go to catchupmath.com and then enter the school Login Name and their individual Password.  
                Try this yourself with the jd12345 sample student.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Give students a goal:</b>
                Students will do best with Catchup Math when they know what you expect.  
                You might tell students something like one or these:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Your goal is write your answers to the Required Problems on the Show Work screen 
                        so I can review your work – please enter your answers as if it were homework.  
                        Feel free to improve your answers after viewing the lessons or tutorials.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You goal is to proceed through the assigned program to the end.  
                        I will be reviewing your quiz scores to see how you are doing, so please try your best on the quizzes.  
                        Do not worry about a poor score on a quiz, because you will be given a chance to improve your score 
                        after the review and practice.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Your goal is to complete the Algebra 1 and Geometry program at your own pace, as that covers the material
                        you will need to be successful in Algebra 2. You will only be graded on whether or not you have completed
                        the programs, not on the Show Work or intermediate quiz scores.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        Complete at least <N> Required Problems for homework.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                         Work until you score at least 70% on a quiz
                     </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                 <b>Best practices in a computer lab:</b>
                 If you will be present in the lab, then tell students how to ask for assistance 
                 (e.g., place a book on top of their monitor).  Also, make sure the students have
                 a way to watch the videos, you may need to buy some 99-cent headsets.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>How to use the Show Work feature:</b>
                 Students enter their own answers on an electronic whiteboard, and you can view their work at any time. 
                 Be sure to tell students what you expect. You might require them to show work on all the Practice Problems, 
                 or only problems where they need help.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>College course names:</b>
                 At present we are using the school course names as follows, but our programs apply to college courses as follows:
                 <ul>
                     <li>Beginning or Introductory Algebra = Algebra 1</li>
                     <li>Basic Geometry = Geometry</li>
                      <li>Intermediate Algebra = Algebra 2</li>
                  </ul>
             </li>
        </ul>
