    <h3>Automatic Student Logout</h3>
    <p>
      To keep student accounts secure, a student will be automatically logged out if a new login occurs
      prior to logging out of an existing session.      
    <p>

    <h3>Export Student Data</h3>
    <p>
      Student status and selected report card data can be exported as an Excel spreadsheet by clicking on the Export
      button on the right next to the printer icon.  The spreadsheet for the currently selected students will be
      generated and emailed.

    <h3>Log in As a Student in "Teacher Mode"</h3>
    <p>
      Teachers can now log into any student account by right-clicking on a selected student from the summary listing.
      In teacher mode, there is a button to mark all quiz answers correct, and also there is no requirement to view all
      the required problems/activities in order to advance. This has many uses but was created primarily for convenience
      in reviewing new custom programs.
    </p>

    <h3>Change to Allowing Games</h3>
    <p>
      The Advanced registration option for restricting games now prevents the playing of games entirely. As the games
      are appreciated by students and they have a learning benefit, we suggest that you only restrict games for students
      who play them excessively.
    </p>

    <h3>Custom Quizzes</h3>
    <p>
      The Custom button now allows the creation of custom quizzes as well as custom programs. Teachers may select
      questions from our question bank to create a custom quiz or test. Note that you can tell students they are
      required to show their work on the whiteboard.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Core Alignment Table Available</h3>
    <p>
      A table is now available showing specific lesson correlation with Common Core standards. See our Math Educators
      page (easily found from the site map at the bottom of our Home page).
    </p>

    <h3>Past Quiz Results Now Available to Teachers</h3>
    <p>
      All quizzes taken by students are now available in Student Detail History.
      <!-- Any whiteboard scratch work for       quizzes is saved there as well. --> 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Select Section Number of Program</h3>
    <p>
      Using the Advanced Options feature in Registration or Edit Student, it is now possible to select the section number
      of an assigned proficiency or graduation preparation program. This can be handy in special circumstances,
      e.g., a student accidentally clicked Check Quiz without submitting any answers and you want to let them start over.
