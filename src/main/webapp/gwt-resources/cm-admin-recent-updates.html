        With our ASSIGNMENTS feature you can assign lessons and problems for
        automatic grading (for classwork or homework).

    <p>
        You can review student whiteboard steps, adjust grades, and provide feedback (in red).

    <h3>No More Mindless Clicking!</h3>
    <p>
    Now, students must enter an answer to those problems that accept answers, before they can click the NEXT button to see the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
    Moreover, we now record the percentage of first-try answers that are correct and display that for the student as well as in Student Detail History.

    <h3>Deleting or Modifying a CP or CQ</h3>
    <p>
    Previously, if a Custom Program or Custom Quiz was ever assigned, it could not be modified or deleted. 
    We have added a Delete/Archive button to the Custom feature that lets you archive an in-use CP or CQ. 
    Once Archived, the CP or CQ will be unavailable for future assignment and may be copied to a new version and modified.
    </p>
     
     
    <h3>Quizzes Now Different Every Time</h3>
    <p>
    In addition to switching among alternate quizzes for student re-takes, we are now randomizing the order of the questions each time, 
    in an effort to thwart students who seek work-arounds to learning the material to pass the quizzes. 
    </p>

      to submit answers using the whiteboard to assure yourself that they understand the material.
    </p>
    <h3>NEXT Button Navigation</h3>
    <p>
      The NEXT button now lets students select lessons in any order they wish rather than requiring them
      to advance linearly.
    </p>
    <h3>Two New Built-in Custom Programs</h3>
    <p>
      We have added two more built in Custom Programs called Foundations A and Foundations B. These cover
      selected topics generally covered in grades 3-4 and 5-6 respectively.
