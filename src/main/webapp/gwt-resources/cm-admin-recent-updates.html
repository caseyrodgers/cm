    <h1>Recent Feature Updates</h1>

    <h2>Log in As a Student in "Teacher Mode"</h2>
    <p>
      Teachers can now log into any student account by right-clicking on a selected student from the summary listing.
      In teacher mode, there is a button to mark all quiz answers correct, and also there is no requirement to view all
      the required problems/activities in order to advance. This has many uses but was created primarily for convenience
      in reviewing new custom programs.
    </p>

    <h2>Change to Allowing Games</h2>
    <p>
      The Advanced registration option for restricting games now prevents the playing of games entirely. As the games
      are appreciated by students and they have a learning benefit, we suggest that you only restrict games for students
      who play them excessively.
    </p>

    <h2>Custom Quizzes</h2>
    <p>
      The Custom button now allows the creation of custom quizzes as well as custom programs. Teachers may select
      questions from our question bank to create a custom quiz or test. Note that you can tell students they are
      required to show their work on the whiteboard.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Core Alignment Table Available</h2>
    <p>
      A table is now available showing specific lesson correlation with Common Core standards. See our Math Educators
      page (easily found from the site map at the bottom of our Home page).
    </p>

    <h2>Past Quiz Results Now Available to Teachers</h2>
    <p>
      All quizzes taken by students are now available in Student Detail History. Any whiteboard scratch work for
      quizzes is saved there as well.
    </p>
