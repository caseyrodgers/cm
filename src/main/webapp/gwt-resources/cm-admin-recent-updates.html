    <h3>Deleting or Modifying a CP or CQ</h3>
    <p>
    Previously, if a Custom Program or Custom Quiz was ever assigned, it could not be modified or deleted. 
    We have added a Delete/Archive button to the Custom feature that lets you archive an in-use CP or CQ. 
    Once Archived, the CP or CQ will be unavailable for future assignment and may be copied to a new version and modified.
    </p>
     
     
    <h3>Quizzes Now Different Every Time</h3>
    <p>
    In addition to switching among alternate quizzes for student re-takes, we are now randomizing the order of the questions each time, 
    in an effort to thwart students who seek work-arounds to learning the material to pass the quizzes. 
    </p>

    <h3>Extra Practice Problems</h3>
    <p>
      We have removed the hints and steps from the Extra Practice Problems. You can ask your students
      to submit answers using the whiteboard to assure yourself that they understand the material.
    </p>
    <h3>NEXT Button Navigation</h3>
    <p>
      The NEXT button now lets students select lessons in any order they wish rather than requiring them
      to advance linearly.
    </p>
    <h3>Two New Built-in Custom Programs</h3>
    <p>
      We have added two more built in Custom Programs called Foundations A and Foundations B. These cover
      selected topics generally covered in grades 3-4 and 5-6 respectively.
