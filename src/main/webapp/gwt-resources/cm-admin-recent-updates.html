    <h3>Five New Built-in Custom Programs</h3>
    <p>
        Five new Built-in Custom Programs have been added, one for each core course, in order to make it more
        convenient to select lesson topics for your students, in any order that you wish. Consider using some
        our lessons in place of a (heavy) textbook - you can add, delete, and re-order the lessons.
    </p>

    <h3>Print Function for Program Details</h3>
    <p>
        The Program Details feature now lets you print the display after you have made a selection of program sections.

    <h3>Admin Menu Changes</h3>
    <p>
        Manage Groups has been moved within Student Registration. Refresh List has been removed.
    </p>
     
    <h3>Time on Task</h3>
    <p>
        A time on task estimate is provided in Student Detail History, Highlights, Report Card and Export. The estimate is based on a standard time assigned to each
        resource accessed by a student; Quiz: 15 minutes, Flashcard: 10 minutes, Game: 10 minutes, Required Practice Activity: 10 minutes, Extra Practice Problem: 5 minutes,
        Quiz Results: 5 minutes, Required Practice Problem: 5 minutes, Video: 5 minutes, Whiteboard: 5 minutes, and Lesson: 3 minutes.
    </p>

    <h3>Parallel Programs</h3>
    <p>
        We have added a new feature called Parallel Programs for students to be assigned multiple separate programs within Catchup Math. For example, a student can be
        working on a Subject/Chapter Program in their regular math class, as well as a separate Proficiency Program in their math lab. Or, teachers can use this feature
        to assign extra work or a Custom Program or Quiz. Select the Parallel Programs button under Student Registration. Students access Parallel Programs by logging in
        with their school Login Name and the name of the Parallel Program as their initial password, and then providing their Personal Password. Student work is saved in
        Student Detailed History and is reflected in Report Cards, Export, and Highlights. Please contact your Account Manager for more details.

    <h3>Automatic Student Logout</h3>
    <p>
      To keep student accounts secure, a student will be automatically logged out if a new login occurs
      prior to logging out of an existing session.      
    <p>

    <h3>Export Student Data</h3>
    <p>
      Student status and selected report card data can be exported as an Excel spreadsheet by clicking on the Export
      button on the right next to the printer icon.  The spreadsheet for the currently selected students will be
      generated and emailed.

    <h3>Log in As a Student in "Teacher Mode"</h3>
    <p>
      Teachers can now log into any student account by right-clicking on a selected student from the summary listing.
      In teacher mode, there is a button to mark all quiz answers correct, and also there is no requirement to view all
      the required problems/activities in order to advance. This has many uses but was created primarily for convenience
      in reviewing new custom programs.
    </p>

    <h3>Change to Allowing Games</h3>
    <p>
      The Advanced registration option for restricting games now prevents the playing of games entirely. As the games
      are appreciated by students and they have a learning benefit, we suggest that you only restrict games for students
      who play them excessively.
    </p>

    <h3>Custom Quizzes</h3>
    <p>
      The Custom button now allows the creation of custom quizzes as well as custom programs. Teachers may select
      questions from our question bank to create a custom quiz or test. Note that you can tell students they are
      required to show their work on the whiteboard.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Core Alignment Table Available</h3>
    <p>
      A table is now available showing specific lesson correlation with Common Core standards. See our Math Educators
      page (easily found from the site map at the bottom of our Home page).
    </p>

    <h3>Past Quiz Results Now Available to Teachers</h3>
    <p>
      All quizzes taken by students are now available in Student Detail History.
      <!-- Any whiteboard scratch work for quizzes is saved there as well. --> 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Select Section Number of Program</h3>
    <p>
      Using the Advanced Options feature in Registration or Edit Student, it is now possible to select the section number
      of an assigned proficiency or graduation preparation program. This can be handy in special circumstances,
      e.g., a student accidentally clicked Check Quiz without submitting any answers and you want to let them start over.
