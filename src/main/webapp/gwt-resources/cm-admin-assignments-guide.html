<h1>Using the Assignments Tool</h1>

<p>
To create automatically-graded homework and classwork assignments, select the Assignments button on the menu bar.
</p>


<p>
Assign problems to students (for classwork or homework) for any Group or selected students. 
When students log in to Catchup Math, they can work on any active Assignments. Problems are
automatically graded and the scores are available to teachers in an online Gradebook. Students 
can show their work on our online whiteboard.
</p>

<p>
<b>Creating Assignments</b>: Choose any of our problems by subject, level, or by Common Core
State Standard. Set a due date and whether to allow late submissions. Include a comment for 
students (e.g., the lessons covered).  Assign to an entire group, or choose specific students.
</p>



<p>
<b>Grading</b>: Problems will be automatically graded except for any whiteboard (WB) problems you
choose. If WB problems are assigned, you manually grade them online. Also, you can change the 
mark for any problem (e.g., give half-credit for a problem with the wrong answer but accurate 
whiteboard steps).  Student progress can be tracked in the online Gradebook.
</p>


<p>
<b>Open book</b>: Students can view Catchup Math lessons and videos to get help while working on
Assignments.
</p>

<p>
<b>Feedback to students</b>: After an assignment is Closed, students can see their score. Also,
teachers can provide feedback (in red) using the whiteboard at any time. Students can also view
step-by-step instructions for correctly answering the problem.
</p>

<p>
<b>Re-using Assignments</b>: You can copy an assignment for re-use within the same Group (e.g.,
 rom last term) or import to/from another Group.
