<h1>Guide to Assignments</h1>

<p>
Assign problems to students (for classwork or homework) for any Group. When students
log in, they can work on any active Assignments. Problems are automatically graded and
the scores are available to you in an online Gradebook. Students show their work on our
online whiteboard.
</p>
<p>
<b>Creating Assignments:</b> Choose any of our problems. Set a due date and whether to
allow late submissions. Include a comment for students (e.g., the lessons covered).
</p>
<p>
<b>Grading:</b> Problems will be automatically graded except for any whiteboard (WB)
problems you assign. If WB problems are assigned, you grade those online. Also, you can
change the mark for any problem (e.g., to give half-credit for a problem with the wrong
answer but good whiteboard steps.).
</p>
<p>
<b>Open book:</b> Students can view Catchup Math lessons to get help while working on
Assignments.
</p>
<p>
<b>Feedback to students:</b> After the grades are released to the students, or an assignment
is Closed, students can see their score. Also, teachers can give feedback (in red) using the
whiteboard at any time. Best of all, after the grades are released, students can view
step-by-step solutions for the problems.
</p>
<p>
<b>Re-using Assignments:</b> You can copy an assignment for re-use within the same Group
(e.g., from last term) or import from another Group.
