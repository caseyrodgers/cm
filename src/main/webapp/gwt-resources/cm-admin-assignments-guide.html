	<h1>Guide to Assignments</h1>
	<p>Assign problems to students (for classwork or homework). When
		students log in, they can work on any open assignments. Students can
		show their work on the whiteboard, or you can require work to be
		submitted separately on paper. Problems will be automatically graded
		and student answers are available for teacher viewing at any time.</p>

	<p><b>Creating Assignments</b>: Choose any multiple-choice, enter-answer,
		or whiteboard answer problem from our problem bank. Assignments must
		be made for all students in a Group. Set a due date and whether to
		allow late submissions. Include a comment for students (e.g., the
		lessons covered).</p>

	<p><b>Grading</b>: Enter-answer and multiple-choice problems will be
		automatically graded. If whiteboard-answer problems are assigned,
		teachers grade those online. Teachers can change the mark for any
		problem (e.g., to give half-credit for a problem with the wrong answer
		but good whiteboard effort.).</p>

	<p><b>Open book</b>: Students can view any Catchup Math lessons, so they
		can get as much help as they need to do well. As an option, students
		can be told if their entered answers are correct or not as they work
		on the assignments</p>

	<p><b>Feedback to students</b>: Students can see their score on
		assignments after the due date, and teachers can give feedback (in
		red) using the whiteboard at any time.</p>

	<p><b>Re-using Assignments</b>: You can copy an assignment for re-use
		within the same group (e.g., from last semester) or from another
		group.</p>
