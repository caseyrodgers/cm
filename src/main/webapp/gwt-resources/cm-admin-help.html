                <b>Getting started:</b>
                Your account comes with one "sample" student named John Doe with
                passcode JD12345. You can log in as this student and try some
                quizzes, review, and practice, and then log back in to your
                administration account and view the reports. You can delete the
                sample account at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Registering students:</b>
                Students will log in with your school-wide username and the
                individual passcode you assign. They will see the name you enter for
                them at the top of their student screen with an indicator of their
                progress.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Passcode:</b>
                The student passcodes should be easy for them to remember, but hard
                for other students to guess, such as their student ID number.
                Letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens are allowed. Passcodes are
                not case sensitive.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Group:</b>
                You may find it convenient to assign students to groups, using a
                course name, teacher name, class period, etc. Group names are
                optional.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Program:</b>
                Each of the program types that you may select are described below.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Auto-Enrollment Program:</b>
                If you select this program the student takes a sequence of quizzes
                and will then be enrolled for the lowest Subject Proficiency Program
                where they appear to need review.
            </li>
            <li>
                <li>
                    <b>Subject Proficiency Program:</b>
                    Select the course for which you would like to provide review and
                    practice for the student. Each program is broken down into four
                    quiz-review sections enough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Subject and Chapter Program:</b>
                    Select both a subject and a particular chapter-topic where you want
                    the student to begin. Students will be advanced to the next chapter
                    when they complete a chapter.

                    <b>Graduation Preparation Program:</b>
                    This program covers material through Algebra 1 and is based on the
                    California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE). It consists of 8
                    sections. Graduation preparation for other states will be added,
                    but this test will be helpful for all students.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Pass percentage:</b>
                    After each quiz, a student is assigned review and practice based on
                    the wrong answers. If a student 'failed' the quiz, they will take a
                    quiz on the same material. The pass percentage is selected by you
                    based on how well you want them to learn the material before moving
                    to the next section of the course.
