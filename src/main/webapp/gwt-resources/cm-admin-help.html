            <li>
                <b>Getting started:</b>
                Your account comes with one "sample" student named John Doe with
                password JD12345. You can log in as this student and try some
                quizzes, review, and practice, and then log back in to your
                administration account and view the reports. You can delete the
                sample account at any time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Registering students:</b>
                Students will log in with your school-wide username and the
                individual password you assign. They will see the name you enter for
                them at the top of their student screen with an indicator of their
                progress.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Password:</b>
                The student passwords should be easy for them to remember,
                but hard for other students to guess, such as their student ID number.
                Email addresses, letters, numbers, periods, and hyphens are allowed.
                Passwords are not case sensitive.            
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Group:</b>
                You may find it convenient to assign students to groups, using a
                course name, teacher name, class period, etc. Group names are
                optional.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Program:</b>
                Each of the program types that you may select are described below.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Auto-Enrollment Program:</b>
                If you select this program the student takes a sequence of quizzes
                and will then be enrolled for the lowest Subject Proficiency Program
                where they appear to need review.
            </li>
             <li>
                 <b>Subject Proficiency Program:</b>
                 Select the course for which you would like to provide review and
                 practice for the student. Each program is broken down into four
                 quiz-review sections.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>Subject and Chapter Program:</b>
                 Select both a subject and a particular chapter-topic where you want
                 the student to begin. Students will be advanced to the next chapter
                 when they complete a chapter.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>Graduation Preparation Programs:</b>
                 These programs cover material up through Algebra 1 and you may select either the California 
                 (CAHSEE) or Texas (TAKS). These programs should apply quite well to all states.
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>Passing Quizzes:</b>
                 After each quiz, a student is assigned review and practice based on the wrong answers. If a student 
                 scored less than 70%, they will take a different quiz on the same material after the review. If they passed, 
                 they will move ahead in the program after the review.
             </li>
        </ul>
