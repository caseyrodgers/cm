                                Operation requires Flash (version 8 or later).  Otherwise, Catchup Math should work 
                                with any modern browser (PC or MAC) from any broadband internet connection.

                                <b>Quick Start:</b>
                                 Check in Manage Groups for red-colored group names.
                                 Students go to catchupmath.com, enter your school Login Name and use the group name 
                                 as the password. Students will be prompted to self-register and can start immediately
                                 on the associated program.                 
                            </li>

                                Catchup Math will remediate and review the named subject.  
                                For example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                         To prepare students for Algebra 1, select the Pre-Algebra Proficiency program.
                                    </li>
                                    <!--
                                    <li>
                                         To provide review of Areas and Volumes, select that specific Pre-algebra Chapter program.
                                    </li>
                                    -->
                                    <li>
                                        For a weak student about to take Geometry, enroll them in Pre-Algebra Proficiency 
                                        (they will be automatically advanced to Algebra 1 when they have successfully reviewed
                                        their Pre-Algebra learning gaps).
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If you are not sure where to place a student, use the Auto-Enrollment program. The
                                        student will be given one or more quizzes to place them in the lowest program where
                                        they need help.  Then, you can monitor their progress until they advance to the target level. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        To concentrate on a specific topic (roughly correlated with the chapters in leading
                                        math textbooks), select a "Subject and Chapter" program.  Then select a chapter topic
                                        from the drop-down menu. 
                                    </li>

                                <b>Give students a brief outline of how Catchup Math works:</b>
                                Students will be given quizzes.  Based on the problems they get wrong, the program will select
                                one or more review topics. For each review topic, there are practice problems to solve, lessons
                                to read, videos to watch, activities to try out.  At a minimum, students must attempt the required
                                practice problems or activities and receive a check-mark in order to proceed to the next topic.
                                But students should be encouraged to try the other resources as well.  Once the quiz has been
                                passed and the topics reviewed, students are advanced to the next section of the program that
                                covers new topics.
                            </li>

                                <b>Tell students how you want them to use Catchup Math:</b>
                                Students should answer the quizzes carefully, working out their answers with pencil and paper 
                                or our whiteboard, so they only receive lessons they really need. 
                                You might give students a goal for their next session, such as work until you have passed at 
                                least two quizzes.

                                 Visit each student, offer assistance as needed, and make sure the student is trying all the 
                                 various learning resources. Also, review their progress on the spot by clicking the Help button
                                 and then clicking the Student History button.

                                 The Student Detail History button will present a reverse chronological history for a selected student.
                                 While viewing the history, select any line to view the lessons (standards) covered and those which
                                 the student was prescribed to review.  Also, the entered "Show Work" may be viewed. 
                                 There is a Report Card that summarizes student progress and effort including their prescribed lessons.  
                                 The student summary page may be printed for the all registered students or for any selected group.  
                                 The Student Detail History and Report Card may also be printed.
