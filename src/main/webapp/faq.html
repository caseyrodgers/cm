                        service for struggling middle/high school students and under-prepared college students. Students log
                        in at school or home, take short quizzes, and then receive targeted remediation based on incorrect answers.
                        Live online tutoring is also available with the service, as an option.</div>

                    <div class='faq-item-content'>Definitely not! We recommend that all students use Catchup Math at the beginning 
                        of every math course so that they are prepared to succeed.  Also, Catchup Math can be used by all students
                        taking a final exam or high-stakes test where both students and the school can benefit from higher math
                        scores.  Many teachers use Catchup Math in conjunction with their ongoing classes.</div>

                    <div class='faq-item-content'>We have middle/high school programs for remedial review of Pre-algebra, Algebra 1,
                        Geometry, and Algebra 2. Each subject area may be used as as a full-course review or targeted at scope/sequence
                        (chapter) topics selected by a teacher. Catchup Math covers Basic Math and Graduation Exam Preparation (which
                        may be used as a Precalculus Readiness Program).  Also, teachers can compose custom programs from the full
                        repertoire of Catchup Math learning resources.</div>

                        few hours to get caught up.  Our usage history shows that a student using Catchup Math 2 to 3 times per week will

                        (also called shadow or mirrored or pull-out) classes, homebound programs, and summer school programs. Catchup Math
                        can be used in the computer lab or at home. Additionally, Catchup Math may be used at the beginning of every math
                        and science course to review prerequisite material.  Last but not least, Catchup Math may be used to prepare students
                        for success in standardized tests.</div>

                        math or science courses. We recommend that colleges license Catchup Math for use at the campus learning center.

                        that we only give them lessons they need to learn and are ready to learn.  Our multi-modal lessons provide variety
                        and accommodate many learning styles. The learning activities including math games are fun!  Based on actual student

                        when working the practice problems. Students are actually required to work only the practice problems, and needn't

                        Students can view their own progress graphically as well via an on-screen pie chart.  Students have full access to a

                        solving practice problems. The work is saved for review by their teacher, and can even be shown to an online tutor
                        for assistance. Our Show-Work feature provides an excellent indicator of the student effort and understanding (and can

                        tutoring. Catchup Math is far easier to use for both teachers and students, and is far less expensive. The student pages
                        and reports have an elegant, simple structure that gets the job done.  Although we provide Professional Development,
                        the use of Catchup Math is so intuitive that all your students can be using the service on the same day the license
