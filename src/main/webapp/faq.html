                    <div class='faq-item-content'><div class='wrap'>Catchup Math is an online service that helps students get caught up - and then keep up
                        - in math. Research-based and performance-proven, Catchup Math diagnoses and fills in learning gaps for middle/high school students
                        and under-prepared college students. Students log in at school or home, take short quizzes, and then receive targeted, multi-modal
                        instruction based on incorrect answers. Teachers easily generate reports to track usage and progress</div></div>

                    <div class='faq-item-content'><div class='wrap'>Definitely not! We recommend that all secondary students use Catchup Math as a review
                        at the beginning of every math course so they are prepared to succeed. Also, Catchup Math can be used by students taking a final
                        exam or high-stakes test where both the students and the school can benefit from higher math scores. Many teachers use Catchup Math
                        in conjunction with their ongoing classes.</div></div>

                        Pre-algebra, Algebra 1, Geometry, and Algebra 2. Each subject area may be used as a full-course review or targeted at scope/sequence
                        (subject/chapter) topics selected by a teacher. Catchup Math also covers Graduation Exam Preparation (which may be used as a Pre-Calculus
                        Readiness Program). In addition, teachers can create custom programs and quizzes by selecting from the full repertoire of Catchup Math
